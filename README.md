# Harveys-of-Stretton
Application designed for my HND course using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
This application was developed for my HND (level 5 BTEC) As part of a full design development.
The areas that have been identified as complications on the current software are the car details are not logged on to the system correctly and the customer details are not being verified.
By creating an application in which the fields are required to be filled in to ensure all the details are logged correctly and are verified.
If the situation is to stay the same for Harveys of Stretton with the car details not being logged correctly this will lead to not being able to find the details, meaning poor customer service and loss of revenue and reputation.
With the customer details if they are not verified it means the inability to have effective marketing and again poor customer service leading to loss of revenue and reputation.
The application will record all of the vehicle details and store them to the database allowing them to be searched for when needed, it shall also record customer details correctly and store to the same database for ease of access and to allow better marketing.
